## Tackling Modality Heterogeneity with Multi-View Calibration Network for Multimodal Sentiment Detection   

Thank you for your interest in our paper titled "Tackling Modality Heterogeneity with Multi-View Calibration Network for Multimodal Sentiment Detection" [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.287.pdf). 

Recently, we noticed the growing demand for the associated code. Given the initial code has not been well-organized and commented to the standards required for open-source release, we have not made it open-source directly. To support researchers and developers interested in this domain, if you would like to access the code, please get in touch with us at wywy@tju.edu.cn. We will provide all the necessary documents and codes to assist you in reproducing this paper.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your contributions to the field.
