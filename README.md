## Tackling Modality Heterogeneity with Multi-View Calibration Network for Multimodal Sentiment Detection   

Thank you for your interest in our paper titled "Tackling Modality Heterogeneity with Multi-View Calibration Network for Multimodal Sentiment Detection" [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.287.pdf). Recently, we noticed the growing demand for the associated code. Given the initial code has not been well-organized and commented to the standards required for open-source release, we have not made it open-source directly. However, we are committed to supporting researchers and developers interested in this domain. If you would like to access the code, please get in touch with us at wywy@tju.edu.cn.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your contributions to the field.
